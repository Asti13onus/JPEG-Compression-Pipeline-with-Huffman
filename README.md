# README for the project

The output is a binary file which hasn't been formated according to the JPEG format. To check the reduction in file size, see the last cell of the notebook. Also, this is not a particularly efficient implementation as it takes a lot of time to compress even a single image. To change the input image, simply change the file path in the cell(which is currently set to /content/liberty.jpg)
